    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence-to-Sequence RNN:**\n",
    "  - **Machine Translation:** Converting a sequence in one language to a sequence in another language (e.g., English to French).\n",
    "  - **Text Summarization:** Generating a concise summary from a longer document.\n",
    "  - **Speech Recognition:** Converting an audio sequence into a text sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence-to-Vector RNN:**\n",
    "  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Encoding a sequence of words (e.g., a sentence) into a vector for classification.\n",
    "  - **Document Classification:** Encoding an entire document into a vector for categorization.\n",
    "  - **Feature Extraction:** Representing a sequence (e.g., a time series) as a fixed-size vector for downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector-to-Sequence RNN:**\n",
    "  - **Image Captioning:** Generating a sequence of words to describe an image, where the image is encoded into a vector.\n",
    "  - **Text Generation:** Generating a sequence of words from a fixed-size vector representation, such as generating text from a context vector in dialogue systems.\n",

    "## 2. Why use Encoder-Decoder RNNs for Automatic Translation?\n",
    "**Answer:** Encoder-decoder RNNs are preferred for automatic translation over plain sequence-to-sequence RNNs because:\n",
    "- **Handling Variable-Length Inputs and Outputs:** Encoder-decoder architecture can handle sequences of different lengths, which is crucial for translation.\n",
    "- **Improved Contextual Understanding:** The encoder captures the entire input sequence into a context vector, which is then used by the decoder to generate the output sequence, allowing for better handling of complex dependencies and contexts.\n",

    "## 3. Combining Convolutional Neural Networks with RNNs for Video Classification\n",
    "**Answer:** To classify videos, you can combine CNNs with RNNs as follows:\n",
    "- **CNN for Feature Extraction:** Use a CNN to extract spatial features from individual frames of the video.\n",
    "- **RNN for Temporal Analysis:** Feed these features into an RNN (such as an LSTM or GRU) to analyze the temporal sequence of features across frames.\n",
    "- **Integration:** The CNN processes each frame independently, while the RNN captures the temporal relationships between frames, allowing for both spatial and temporal patterns to be learned.\n",

    "## 4. Advantages of `dynamic_rnn()` over `static_rnn()`\n",
    "**Answer:** `dynamic_rnn()` has several advantages over `static_rnn()`:\n",
    "- **Variable-Length Sequences:** `dynamic_rnn()` handles sequences of varying lengths within a batch, making it more flexible.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency:** It allocates memory dynamically, reducing memory usage for variable-length sequences.\n",
    "- **Training Efficiency:** It can be more efficient during training since it does not need to pad sequences to the maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Dealing with Variable-Length Sequences\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Variable-Length Input Sequences:** Use padding to standardize sequence lengths within a batch and masking to ignore padded values during processing.\n",
    "- **Variable-Length Output Sequences:** Similar to inputs, use padding and masking to manage output sequences of varying lengths, and use techniques like teacher forcing during training.\n",

    "## 6. Distributing Training and Execution of Deep RNNs Across Multiple GPUs\n",
    "**Answer:** A common way to distribute training and execution across multiple GPUs includes:\n",
    "- **Data Parallelism:** Splitting the training data across GPUs and combining gradients from each GPU.\n",
    "- **Model Parallelism:** Splitting the RNN model itself across multiple GPUs to handle large models.\n",
    "- **Framework Support:** Utilizing deep learning frameworks that support multi-GPU training (e.g., TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` or PyTorch's `torch.nn.DataParallel`).\n",
